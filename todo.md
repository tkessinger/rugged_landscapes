To-do:

-Study theory of Ochs and Desai (2015).

-Develop equivalent theory in two regimes:
1) long ridge versus short valley, all steps along ridge of equal size (no epistasis vs. sign epistasis)
2) long ridge versus short valley, last step along ridge much larger than the others (synergistic epistasis vs. sign epistasis)
(That's the most favorable possible setup for valley crossing.)

-Finish coding fitness landscape models (alpha-HoC, random Mt. Fuji, NK model).

-Study effects of "steepness", as well as related parameters (alpha in alpha-HoC, sigma in RMF, population size) on valley crossing propensity.

-Optional: consider increasing the number of loci and seeing what happens.

-Look at an "explicit" ridge model (analogous to the ridge models above--three loci, something like 110 being the maximum, with 100 and 010 being valleys and all other paths being ridges to 110).

-Consider looking at some "real" fitness landscapes.
